# League of Legends Client Language Changer
Created by ColumnaeV

Simplistic tool for those who play League in a different language then their current regionally locked language.

Steps:
- Put the .exe file in "..\Riot Games\League of Legends" directory.
- Run the application.
- Follow what's displayed on the command prompt that opens.

Process of the application:
- Edits the LeagueClientSettings.yaml found in "League of Legends\Config" directory.
- Creates a shortcut with the selected locale (language).
- Launches LoL through the shortcut created.

Common issues:
1.) Ran .exe but client does not open:
  - This is due to the Riot client (not the game client) not being open yet. What will happen is that the Riot client will open but not launch the game. If there was no errors in the .exe then you just have to click the play button on the Riot client and it should launch the game with the selected language.

If you run into issues, please open an issue here so I can look at it.
